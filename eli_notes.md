CS Head Start
=============

- Big pictur: What you will learn in CS
	- Maybe interested rn, but might not know what to learn
- Example on cryptography will occur

- Get the most out of your lectures

Head start:
- Learn how to get the most out of this lecture
- Many first years don't realize how to learn
- You will have 10 minutes after the lecture to talk to the models
- Everyone has a different way of taking notes

What CS is about:
- Steve jobs?
- Typing?
- Building computers?
- Secret hacker?

The science of computers:
- A tool used by humans to solve things easily
- How to use this tool to solve various problems
- Silicon is the core of computers
- Magic to go from silicon, to motherboards, to a macbook
- CSC258 Teaches about the motherboard magic (from silicon to motherboard)
- CSC369 Teaches about the motherboard to OS magic

Computers to solve problems:
- Sudoku
- Game of Go
- Recognize speech
- Display a Pokémon
- Recognize objects in pictures

- Computers are better at repeating tasks than humans
- Algorithms programmed by humans can be über helpful

Example: Text Encryption (Substitution Cipher)
- Replace each letter with another letter

Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher)
- The alphabet is shifted by a certain amount

Exercise 1
Left shift of 3
ELALO -> HODOR
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Exercise 2
Right shift of 4
XLIVEW E JMVI WXEVXMRK MR QC LIEVX
THERES A FIRE STARTING IN MY HEART

If problems are way too long, might as well write a script to do it.
We need the cipher to find a message, unless we brute force.

If we brute force, we have to go through 25 times (different shift amuonts)

Better algo:
- Find the frequency of each letter
- 'E' is the most used letter, so we can guess which letter will be translated
- If 'G' is the most frequent letter, it is _probably_ what 'E' translated to

Head Start Tips:
- Don't get too obsessed with coding in and of itself
- The more important thing you are learning is the ideas behind the code
- Design, math, systems, algorithms, etc.

3 virtues of a great computer scientist
- Laziness
	- Automate things with computers
- Impatience
	- Speed up your algorithm when possible
- Hubris
	- Be proud of your code. Don't let people say bad things about your code

Math Head Start
===============
- Make sure you know high school math inside and out
- CRA:
	- CRA is blest
	- Guages if you are well versed in the basics or not
	- Counts toward your grade
	- Small amount of your grade - maybe 3%
	- Tests if you have the basics down pat from high school
	- You should already know everything that's in the CRA
	- A 60 in the CRA probably means you will fail
	- You should get an 85+ on the CRA, or else you probably are not ready
Content:
	- Basic algebra
	- Functions and graphs
		- Know how to shift, compress, etc.
		- Know trig functions
	- Exponents and logs
		- Solve these equations

Where and how do I write the CRA?
- Internets, from the 23rd to the 25th
- Algorithms are emotionless. It won't let you have more time!
- You have 3 days to write it
- You have 2 attempts at the CRA
	- You have to do the whole thing over again
	- Only your best grade counts
- You have 90 minutes
- Read the CRA handout
- To write the CRA, you will need a login and password for MyLabsPlus
	- Go to http://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/mcs/internal to get login information
- Your initial password is your username
	- Change it! Since it is bad to have a crappy pw
- Get your login and password asap
- Get familiar with the site, where to find stuff, etc
- There are practice tests on the site
	- PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE
	- It comes with review material
	- E.g. a refresher on trig
- MyLabsPlus help session in CC2140 & CC2160 to help with tech issues
- Math help center in DH2027
	- One on one with a TA

Stats Head Start
================
- Forest gump quote:
	- Life is a box of chocolates, you don't know what you're going to get
- The frequencies that Larry showed is a probability distribution
- People make decisions using statistics
	- E.g. the Tibetan monks
- 100 level courses
	- Just 1 course, STA107
		- Pays more attention to theoretical aspects, not practical
	- Gives an introduction to probability and statistics
	- STA215 has no prerequisites, so you can take it in first year
		- Better idea if you want to see the pratical side of things

FSG Head Start
==============
- Tom from the Academic Skills Center
- In first year, FSGs are blest
- Students tend to study by themselves
	- Not bad per se...
	- But studying with other students is beneficial
- People are more creative if they are working with other people

Typical FSG:
- Organize into small groups
- Work in small groups, trying to figure out problems
- FSG leaders will walk around and help students
- Moves students to the board to show different solutions on the board
